# Microchat Branching: Feature Specification

## Overview

Microchat Branching enables users to create contextual sub-conversations from any point in a main chat thread. This feature allows users to explore tangential ideas, deep-dive into specific topics, or refine particular aspects of a conversation without losing the context or cluttering the main discussion.

## Core Concept

Rather than forcing users to choose between continuing a linear conversation or starting an entirely new one, Microchat Branching offers a middle path: **contextual branches** that inherit the full context of their parent conversation up to the branching point.

## Implementation Status

‚úÖ **Backend**: Complete - Database schema, service methods, and API endpoints have been implemented
‚¨ú **Frontend**: Pending - UI components and interactions are still in development

## üéØ Feature Components

### 1. Visual Thread Map

## Backend Implementation

The backend implementation for Microchat Branching has been completed and includes:

### 1. Database Schema

  - `is_branch` boolean flag
  - `parent_message_id` (UUID) - the message from which the branch was created
  - `parent_chat_id` (UUID) - the chat containing the parent message
  - `branch_type` - enum-like text field (deep-dive, refactor, translate, summarize, custom)
  - `branch_status` - ephemeral or pinned
  - `promoted_to_message_id` - UUID of message when branch is promoted to main chat

- Added `microchat_messages` table to store messages within microchats

- Implemented Row Level Security (RLS) policies for secure user-based access control

### 2. Service Layer

- Extended `DatabaseService` with methods to:
  - Create, retrieve, update, and delete microchats and messages
  - Search microchats
  - Retrieve branches by parent message or parent chat
  - Promote branch to main chat
  - Update branch status

## üö´ Features Explicitly Out of Scope

To maintain focus and deliver a high-quality implementation, these features will not be included in the initial implementation:

1. **Multi-Source Import & Spaces**
   - Rationale: Let users start fresh with the new branching paradigm
   - Future: Add import capabilities after branching proves popular

2. **Workspaces, Groups, Tags**
   - Rationale: Branches serve as the primary organizational structure
   - Future: Consider additional organization if branch complexity increases

3. **Hybrid Chat Merges Across Sources**
   - Rationale: Focus purely on branching within a single live session
   - Future: Expand to cross-source merging once core branching is stable

4. **Advanced Semantic Search / Embeddings**
   - Rationale: Basic text search is sufficient for the initial implementation
   - Future: Add embedding-based search in Phase 2

5. **Third-Party Integrations**
   - Rationale: Keep scope to browser-based chat experience
   - Future: Add integrations once core UX is validated

## üöÄ Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Data Model & Backend Foundation

   - Average branches created per conversation

2. **Engagement**
   - Time spent in branch conversations vs. main thread
   - Branch promotion rate (how often insights return to main)

3. **User Satisfaction**
   - Specific feedback on branching experience
   - Branch feature retention (do users who try it once continue to use it)

4. **Technical Performance**
   - Branch creation latency
   - Context switching performance
   - Storage efficiency

## Conclusion

Microchat Branching represents a paradigm shift in conversation management, moving from purely linear interactions to a rich, contextual exploration model. By implementing this feature, MeshMemory will provide users with a powerful tool for exploring ideas while maintaining conversational coherence.

The focused approach‚Äîdeliberately excluding certain features to perfect the branching experience‚Äîwill ensure a high-quality implementation that addresses the core user need: better conversation management and context exploration.
