## 📱 Social Media Preparation

### Twitter/X Launch Thread
```
🧠 After months of building, I'm launching MeshMemory—my AI second brain that never forgets.

🔗 Try it: [link]
⭐ Star it: [github]

Here's what it does 👇

[1/10]

---

❌ The Problem:

We consume information from everywhere—articles, videos, PDFs, conversations.

But when we need it? Gone.

Notes scattered. Search broken. Memory fails.

[2/10]

---

✅ The Solution: An AI second brain

• Ingest anything (text, PDFs, YouTube, web)
• Automatic knowledge graph
• Chat with your memory
• 100% local-first (privacy)
• Open-source

[3/10]

---

🕸️ Knowledge Graph

Every piece of information becomes a node. The AI finds semantic connections automatically.

No tagging. No folders. Just organic clustering.

📥 Multi-Modal Ingestion

- Type notes
- Upload PDFs (auto-chunked)
- Paste YouTube URLs (transcript extracted)
- Save web articles (scraped & cleaned)

Everything searchable in seconds.

💬 AI Chat

Ask questions in natural language:
"What did I learn about RAG systems last week?"

It retrieves context from multiple sources and cites them.

Like ChatGPT, but it knows what YOU know.

[6/10]

🏠 Privacy-First

Runs 100% locally with Ollama + Weaviate.

Your data NEVER leaves your machine.

(Optional cloud mode with Gemini if you want speed)

🔌 Claude Desktop Integration

With MCP, Claude can access your entire MeshMemory.

Imagine Claude + your personal knowledge base.

It's wild.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Backend:
• Weaviate (vector DB)
• FastAPI
• Ollama / Gemini

Frontend:
• Next.js
• TailwindCSS
• 3D Force Graph

[9/10]

🚀 Try it yourself:

✅ Live Demo: [link]
✅ GitHub: [link]
✅ Video Walkthrough: [link]

Free. Open-source. Self-hosted.

RT if you think this is cool 🔥

### LinkedIn Post
```
🧠 I built an AI second brain that never forgets.

After struggling with scattered notes across Notion, Obsidian, and Google Docs, I created MeshMemory—a local-first AI system that:

✅ Ingests any format (PDFs, YouTube, web pages)
✅ Builds a semantic knowledge graph automatically
✅ Lets you chat with your entire memory
✅ Runs 100% locally (privacy-first)
✅ Integrates with Claude Desktop via MCP

The result? I never lose track of what I learn.

### Reddit Posts

**r/selfhosted**
```
Title: I built a local-first AI second brain with knowledge graphs (Open Source)

Body:
Hey r/selfhosted! 

I spent the last few months building MeshMemory, a self-hosted AI knowledge base that runs entirely on your machine.

**Stack:**
- Weaviate (vector database)
- Ollama (local LLM)
- FastAPI + Next.js
- Docker for easy deployment

**Features:**
- Ingest PDFs, YouTube transcripts, web pages
- Automatic semantic knowledge graph
- RAG-powered chat interface
- Optional cloud mode (Gemini)
- MCP integration for Claude Desktop

**Privacy:** Everything runs locally. No data leaves your machine unless you choose cloud mode.

Live demo and source code: [GitHub link]

Would love feedback from the community!
```

**r/MachineLearning**
```
Title: [Project] MeshMemory – Local-first RAG system with graph-based retrieval

Body:
Built an open-source RAG system that uses graph traversal for better context retrieval.

**Technical highlights:**
- Cosine similarity-based link generation
- Configurable threshold for graph sparsity
- Hybrid search (BM25 + vector)
- Graph-augmented RAG (retrieves node + neighbors)

**Stack:** Weaviate, sentence-transformers, Ollama/Gemini

Code + live demo: [link]

Curious to hear thoughts on the graph approach vs. pure vector search.
```
